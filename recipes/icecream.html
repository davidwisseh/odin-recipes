    <p>Ice Cream from the Gods</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

            <p>
                Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the
                mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.
            </p>

                Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract
                and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to
                manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice
                cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.
